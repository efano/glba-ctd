# CTD Profile Measurements

[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve](https://www.nps.gov/glba/index.htm)'s oceanography program consists of 22 permanent monitoring stations that measure standard oceanographic parameters throughout the water column: temperature, salinity, pressure (depth), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR - light penetration from the surface), optical backscatterance (turbidity), dissolved oxygen concentration, and fluorescence (proxy for
chlorophyll-a concentration). Relying heavily on the D3.js library, this web application quickly queries each station by sampling date and data type, allowing users to easily compare monthly, seasonal, and inter-annual variances and profile data trends.
